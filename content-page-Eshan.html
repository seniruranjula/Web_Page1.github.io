                <p>Skiing is a winter sport enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. It involves sliding down
                    snow-covered slopes on skis, which are long, narrow strips of wood, plastic, or metal attached to

                    <br><br>
                    Skiing can be divided into various disciplines, including alpine skiing, cross-country skiing,
                    freestyle skiing, and ski jumping. Alpine skiing involves skiing down steep slopes with turns and
                    jumps, while cross-country skiing involves skiing on flatter terrain for longer distances. Freestyle
                    skiing combines elements of acrobatics and skiing, and includes mogul skiing, aerials, and halfpipe
                    skiing. Ski jumping involves launching off a ski jump and flying as far as possible in the air
                    before landing.
                    <br><br>
                    Skiing requires physical fitness, technical skills, and proper equipment. Skiers need good balance,
                    coordination, and leg strength to navigate through the snow and make turns. They also need to wear
                    warm and waterproof clothing, ski boots, and helmets to protect themselves from the cold and
                    potential falls. Skiing can be a thrilling and rewarding experience for people of all ages and skill
                    levels, and can help improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and overall wellbeing.

                    descending snow-covered slopes on a board that is attached to boots with bindings. Snowboarding
