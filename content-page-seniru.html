            <p>The primary goal of football is to score more goals than the opposing team within the designated time frame. The team with the most goals at the end of the match is declared the winner.
                Football is typically played on a rectangular grass field called a pitch. The field is marked with boundary lines and has goals at each end.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A standard football match consists of two halves, each lasting 45 minutes, with a 15-minute halftime break. Some competitions may have variations in match duration, such as extra time and penalty shootouts in knockout stages.
                Football has specific rules and regulations set by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), the international governing body of the sport. These rules cover aspects like fouls, offside, handball, and more.
                Players on a football team are assigned different positions, each with specific roles and responsibilities. Common positions include goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.

            <br>
            <p>The meaning of a "team sport" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different
                objectives or rules than "traditional" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates
                facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to
                score points. For example, swimming, rowing, sailing, dragon boat racing, and track and field among
                others can also be considered team sports.</p>
