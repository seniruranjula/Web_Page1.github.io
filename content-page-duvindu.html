                <h3>Indoor games were originally invented to help people amuse themselves within the confines of
                    their homes. They were invented to pass time at home when, either the weather was bad or, when,
                    sickness confined a person to his or her bed. Indoor games also meant, mothers could keep a
                    watchful eye on their children while doing their housework.With urbanisation indoor games are
                    becoming more popular. In capital and metro cities a few schools will have their own
                    playgrounds. It is because these these cities and centres have hardly any open space for outdoor
                    games. So more and more institutions are encouraging indoor games.</h3>

                    <h2>Benifits of Indoor Sports</h2>
                    <p>
                        For kids, it is crucial to playing freely to relax and have some fun; instead,
                        a majority of kids today tend to spend most of their time at home just watching television
                        or playing video games.
                        Indoor play areas and indoor games have proven to be a great outlet for kids.
                        This is because they can be active, have fun, and most importantly perhaps play in a clean,
                        safe, and colorful environment. Most well designed and modern indoor play areas feature
                        slides, tunnels,
                        ball pools, bridges, adventure zones, trampolines, and other equipment which can keep your
                        kids engaged for several hours.
                        Regularly playing indoor games such as ping pong helps your kids improve their body fitness
                        since these games incorporate a variety of body movements.
                        Also, experts state that regularly engaging in indoor games such as table tennis helps in
                        developing fast-twitch muscles which can ultimately improve your kid’s reflexes.During the
                        time spent in indoor games, kids usually face several situations and challenges which help
                        them in developing vital skills. For example, interacting with others can help them develop
                        and improve their imagination.
