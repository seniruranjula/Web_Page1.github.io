                <p>Artistic gymnastics is the most well-known and widely followed discipline of gymnastics in the Olympics. It involves both men's and women's events, including individual all-around, team competition, and individual apparatus finals. The apparatus used in artistic gymnastics for men are floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. For women, the apparatus are vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise.
                    <br><br>
                    Rhythmic gymnastics is a discipline performed exclusively by women. It combines elements of ballet, dance, and apparatus manipulation. Gymnasts perform routines with apparatus such as rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon. Rhythmic gymnastics events include individual all-around and group competition, where a team of gymnasts perform coordinated routines with the same apparatus.
                    <br><br>
                    Gymnastics routines are scored based on technical difficulty, execution, artistry, and presentation. Judges assign scores using the Code of Points, which considers the complexity and precision of the performed elements. The highest and lowest scores are dropped, and the remaining scores are averaged to determine the final score.

                <p>Weightlifting in the Olympics consists of two main events for both men and women: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In the snatch, the lifter lifts the barbell from the floor to overhead in one continuous motion. In the clean and jerk, the lifter first lifts the barbell to the shoulders (clean) and then pushes it overhead (jerk).
                    <br><br>
                    Weight Classes: Weightlifters compete in various weight categories to ensure fairness and equal competition. The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) establishes the weight classes for both men and women. These weight classes have maximum limits and include categories such as 55 kg, 61 kg, 67 kg, 73 kg, 81 kg, 87 kg, 96 kg, 102 kg, 109 kg, and +109 kg for men, and 45 kg, 49 kg, 55 kg, 59 kg, 64 kg, 76 kg, 81 kg, 87 kg, 87+ kg for women.
                    <br><br>
                    In Olympic weightlifting, athletes have three attempts to complete each lift (snatch and clean and jerk). The weight on the barbell is progressively increased after each successful attempt. The total of the highest successful snatch and clean and jerk is used to determine the winners in each weight category.
